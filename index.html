  <p>
    The goal of the cmyth project is to produce a lightweight library
    capable of communicating with a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a>
    backend using only the
    <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Category:Myth_Protocol">MythTV
    protocol</a>.  It also supports accessing the backend database via MySQL,
    but this is optional for extended functionality.  This project was
    spun off from the <a href="http://www.mvpmc.org/">mvpmc</a> project, which
    implemented libcmyth in order to create a MythTV frontend for the
    Hauppauge MediaMVP set-top-box.

    The following git repositories exist for the cmyth project:

        cmyth is a portable C language library for communicating with a MythTV
        backend.  The library supports most versions of MythTV dating
        back to 2004 (MythTV protocol versions 8 through 75) and can
	be used to implement a full-featured
        MythTV frontend.  The repository also incudes a few sample
        applications, including a
	<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a> filesystem.

        This is an example MythTV frontend for iOS.

  <p>
    An experimental wrapper around libcmyth can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/gettler/cmyth">here</a> which adds support for
    using libcmyth from several other languages: C++, Common Lisp, Java, Perl,
    PHP, Python, and Ruby.  The API for these languages is not currently as
    extensive as is available in libcmyth.  The goal is to create a clean
    object-oriented API that eventually will include all of the
    functionality that exists in libcmyth.
